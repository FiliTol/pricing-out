[Here is a nasty page where to find all blockchain data](https://gz.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks/)

```{python}
import subprocess, sys, requests

day = "20090103"
template = "blockchair_bitcoin_blocks_"
extension = ".tsv.gz"
page = "https://gz.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks/"

data = subprocess.run(f"wget {page} {template} {day} {extension}")

print(dat)
```
