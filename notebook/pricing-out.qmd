[Here is a nasty page where to find all blockchain data](https://gz.blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks/)

```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = sqlite3.connect('../data/timechain.sqlite')

#timestamps = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT time FROM blocks WHERE id = 840000", conn)
difficulty = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT difficulty FROM blocks WHERE id == 840000", conn)

print(difficulty)
#plt.plot(difficulty,timestamps)

```
